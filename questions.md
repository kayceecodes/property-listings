## Questions
    1. Passing data from files from one component to another causes types to become possibly undefined/optional? (Tried passing data from Listing -> Map & to PropertyCards)
    2. Access to environment variables change based on a file ending in .env.local, .env, .env.production.local etc. 
    - .env has the lowest priority, .env.local is more flexible with accessibility of the environment variables.
